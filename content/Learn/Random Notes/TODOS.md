- [ ] add github workflow to alt-learn and finance-etc
- [x] see how to improve graph view in obsidian quartz
	- global too sparse, local too close.
- [x] move from github page to cloudflare page cos it has traffic monitor
- [ ] see how RSS works by tinkering with quartz,  just for fun
- [x] get domain at cloudflare
- [ ] set up cloudflare email forwarding with custom domain
	- [x] forward to personal email
	- [ ] send using custom domain using sendgrid (?)
	- [ ] send using alias in gmail (?) (require smtp configs)
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13p993z/cloudflare_email_forwarding/
	- https://gist.github.com/irazasyed/a5ca450f1b1b8a01e092b74866e9b2f1
❌ explore #Logseq after December, maybe performance ready and could be self hosted. 
	- the performance ready is done by migrate from markdown to sqlite
	- it should still have import + export option with markdown
    	- at 12/26, it seems like the DB version is still in alpha trial.
    	- as this vault is not expected to reach something that requires a DB to be managed anytime soon, shift focus to investigate compatibility between #Obsidian and #foam
❌ <del>burn out/ hard print #dataview result using #templater such that it can be exported to quartz https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/issues/42 </del>
	- decide to keep things as portable as possible and dataview is not portable to foam
- [ ] set up rclone with cloud storage
- [ ] quartz sort recent note by modified date
- [ ] auto update modified date in vscode
- [ ] power bi project for data visualization.
