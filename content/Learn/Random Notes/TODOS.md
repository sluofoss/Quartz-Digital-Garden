- [ ] add github workflow to alt-learn and finance-etc
- [x] see how to improve graph view in obsidian quartz
	- global too sparse, local too close.
- [x] move from github page to cloudflare page cos it has traffic monitor
- [ ] see how RSS works by tinkering with quartz,  just for fun
- [x] get domain at cloudflare
- [ ] set up cloudflare email forwarding with custom domain
	- forward to personal email + send using custom domain using sendgrid (?)
	- https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/13p993z/cloudflare_email_forwarding/
- [ ] explore #Logseq after December, maybe performance ready and could be self hosted. 
	- the performance ready is done by migrate from markdown to sqlite
	- it should still have import + export option with markdown
- [ ] burn out/ hard print #dataview result using #templater such that it can be exported to quartz https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/issues/42
