# ðŸ¥¼Evaluation, explainability, experiment:â€‹

1. Business knowledge induced feature selectionâ€‹

2. Visualize training metrics to test overfitâ€‹

3. Metric/Model that balance precision recallâ€‹

4. Model calibrationâ€‹

5. Split data by time group insteadâ€‹

6. More and Better plotsâ€‹

# ðŸ§¹Code clean up + feature:â€‹

1. Incorporate post grid search feature selection into the pipeline.â€‹

2. MLFlowâ€‹

3. feature source lineageâ€‹

4. Top "K" based on the data sample ratio instead.â€‹

5. Unsupervised cluster labelingâ€‹

# âš¡Runtime Performance:â€‹

1. Polars â€‹

2. multi metrics param search using Optuna â€‹

3. Combine near miss, random sampling,â€‹

4. Auto EDA with Sweetviz to detect data driftâ€‹
