Previously I have been using a 2 years old Jupyter notebook to analyse all my transactions, perform budgeting and estimate potential costs.

The notebook has become too clunky with repetition, and could benefit from new features. So it's time to refactor. I took this opportunity to look at PyPi and [[Making Packages]] with Rye

The reusable component is now available at
