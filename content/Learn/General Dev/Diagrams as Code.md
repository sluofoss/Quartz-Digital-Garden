# potential diagrams in #markdown 
- prismjs (not a diagram but do syntax highlighting of the code itself)
- plantuml (really old and mature)
- mermaid (avail in github and gitlab)
- d2 
	- (need local install compiler to generate visual, not supported out of the box)
	- have a lot of additional features than mermaid
