# admonition
CommonMark does not have admonition/ alert block syntax. This is supported in #github flavoured markdown and consequently #Obsidian flavoured markdown.


## related terms:
- notice block
- admonitions (using combination of emphasis and emoji mimick custom notice blocks in other flavours of github)
  - https://www.markdownguide.org/hacks/#admonitions
- alert
- quote [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Markdown/comments/183j84c/someone_please_tell_me_how_to_use_markdown_alerts/


## how some md flavour handles alert blocks

#github call this alerts. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts

#obsidian references admonition as callout. https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts

#obsidian seems to support more type of admonition than github. 

#quartz callout come from obsidian. https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/callouts
