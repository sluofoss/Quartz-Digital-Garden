		- still uses pandas as final layer for plotting https://plotly.com/blog/polars-to-build-fast-dash-apps-for-large-datasets/
		- but nothing stopping using polars to do heavy data wrangling prior to convert to pandas for final plot.

# Proprietary

# Proprietary that gets stuffed down everyone's throat
- #powerbi

# Comparison
## ðŸ–Š TODO
- [ ] refactor below into table
## Interesting stuff that #powerbi #tableau cant do, but come with [[Dash]]
- user edited table ( this allows form entry and calculator style interface).
- some custom visual exists in #powerbi appsource or marketplace but are all proprietory and paid.
  - Most likely require power platform (power app and dataflow as well)
- can be achieved with power app, but power app workflow free tier has 750 limit.
  - described as write back by powerbi and tableau
