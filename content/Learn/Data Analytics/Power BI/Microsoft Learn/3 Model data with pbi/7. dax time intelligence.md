time intelligence means modifying the filter context for date filters.


If you have irregular time periods e.g.
- financial months that begin mid-way through the calendar month
- or you need to work with weeks or time periods (hours, minutes) 

the DAX time intelligence functions won't be helpful. 
- soln: need to use the CALCULATE function and pass in hand-crafted date or time filters.


# date table requirement
requires date table for time intelligence

- 1 col of type date
- date col have unique val
- date col have 0 blanks
- date col have no missing date
- date col span full year
- date table marked as date table

## Summarizations over time
- datesytd: return 1 col table 
- totalytd: eval YTD in current filter ctx
- datesbetween: return 1 col date between
- datesinperiod: return 1 col date with start + n interval


## Comparisons over time

shifting time periods

- dateadd
- parallelperiod
- sameperiodlastyear
- nextday, nextmonth, nextquarter, nextyear, previousday, previousmonth, previousquarter, previousyear

use togather with calculate to change eval filter context 
```dax
Revenue PY =
VAR RevenuePriorYear = CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
RETURN
    RevenuePriorYear
```


e.g.
```dax
Revenue YoY % =
VAR RevenuePriorYear = CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Date'[Date]))
RETURN
    DIVIDE(
        [Revenue] - RevenuePriorYear,
        RevenuePriorYear
    )
```

# Additional time intelligence calculations

## single date
firstdate,
lastdate

## Calculate new occurrences
