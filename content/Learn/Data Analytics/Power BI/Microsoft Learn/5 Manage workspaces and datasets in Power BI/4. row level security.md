Row-level security (RLS) uses a DAX filter as the core logic mechanism.

# Configure row-level security with the static method

The static method in row-level security (RLS) uses a fixed value in the DAX filter, while the dynamic method uses a DAX function.

RLS involves several configuration steps, which should be completed in the following order:

1. Create a report in Microsoft Power BI Desktop.    
   1. Import the data.
   2. Confirm the semantic model between both tables
   3. Create the report visuals.
2. Create RLS roles in Power BI Desktop by using DAX
3. Test the roles in Power BI Desktop.
4. Deploy the report to Microsoft Power BI service.
5. Add members to the role in Power BI service.
   1. (i.e. HR vs Sales)
6. Test the roles in Power BI service.

# Configure row-level security with the dynamic method
- userprincipalname

# others

rows in power bi are additive. i.e. multi roles to same user results in union of result. 

if we want intersection, need to create additional role.
