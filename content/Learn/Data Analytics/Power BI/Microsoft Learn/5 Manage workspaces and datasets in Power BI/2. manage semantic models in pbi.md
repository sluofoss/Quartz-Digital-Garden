# Use a Power BI gateway to connect to on-premises data sources.
A gateway facilitates quick, behind-the-scenes communication that flows from a user in the cloud to your on-premises data source and then back again to the cloud.
2 modes avail:
- org mode: connects multiple on-premises data sources to multiple users
  - suitable for complex scenario
- personal mode (only works for pbi desktop on local computer, install gateway locally)
# Configure a scheduled refresh for a semantic model.
steps 
- semantic model + data flow page > schedule refresh > refresh frequency
  - 8/day standard capacity 
  - 48 on premium capacity 
- can also do on demand refresh (manual) 
- check for refresh history and failure here.
# Configure incremental refresh settings.

# Manage and promote semantic models.

# Troubleshoot service connectivity.

# Boost performance with query caching (Premium).
