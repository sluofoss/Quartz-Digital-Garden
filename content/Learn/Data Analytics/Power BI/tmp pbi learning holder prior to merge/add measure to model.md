## Measures
Explicit measures are model calculations that are written in DAX and are commonly referred to as simply measures. 

Implicit measures are columns that can be summarized by visuals in simplistic ways, like count, sum, minimum, maximum, and so on.

In the Fields pane, a column that's shown with the sigma symbol ( âˆ‘ ) indicates two facts:

1. It's a numeric column.
2. It will summarize column values when it is used in a visual (when added to a field well that supports summarization).
