# #data-engineering + DevOps

DevOps practices are crucial for data engineers, who need to build and maintain reliable data pipelines and infrastructure
Key areas include:

- CI/CD for data pipelines and ETL processes
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for data storage and processing systems
- Automated testing of data quality and pipeline functionality
- Monitoring and alerting for data flows and system health
- Version control for data schemas, pipeline code, and configurations



# #data-science + DevOps (sometimes called " [[MLOps]] ")

Focuses on operationalizing machine learning models and maintaining reproducible experiments
Key areas include:

- Version control for model code, training data, and hyperparameters
- Automated model training and validation pipelines
- Model deployment and serving infrastructure
- Model performance monitoring and retraining triggers
- Experiment tracking and reproducibility tools



# #data-analytics + DevOps

Generally has less direct DevOps involvement compared to engineering and science roles
Key areas include:

- Version control for analysis code and dashboards
  - git and pbip for #powerbi
  - azure devops
- Automated report generation and distribution
- Dashboard deployment and maintenance
- Data quality monitoring for analytics datasets
  - monitoring of power bi dashboard meta data
- Access management for analytics tools and data
  - power bi admin portal


# Common DevOps Tools & Practices Across Data Roles:

Version Control: Git for code, DVC for data
Containerization: #docker for consistent environments
Orchestration: #k8s, #airflow for workflows
Infrastructure: Terraform, CloudFormation for provisioning
Monitoring: #prometheus, #grafana for metrics and visualization
CI/CD: #jenkins, GitLab CI for automation

The role of DevOps becomes more critical as data projects move from experimentation to production.
